This repository contains script files of some of the elementary functions I had studied in Abstract Algebra course(MA-305). These can be classified mainly into four categories.


1) Studying Euclidean Algorithms
1.1) Finding GCD - Euclidean_algo, my_gcd, 
1.2) Finding coefficient in Bezout's identity - Extended_Euclidean_algo


2) Prime factorisation
2.1) Prime_factor
2.2) Prime_factors

3) Solving system of congruence relations
3.1) Chinese Remainder theorem

4) Solving the equation of the form f(x) congruent to 0 mod(n).
The following is the sequence of in which I started from simple case and then developed the most general case.
4.1) linear_equation
4.2) linear_equation_s
4.3) hd_prime (hd for Higher Order)
4.4) hd_prime_s
4.5) hd_primepower
4.6) hd_primepower_s
4.7) hd_anynumber - generalised case

Supplementary programs-
value, Permutation, Presentation

Well I worked pretty hard for last part and I am pretty much happy about the way it works. I was following Herstein during my course work.
